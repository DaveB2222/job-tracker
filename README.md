# Job Tracker with TypeScript and Tailwind CSS

## Overview

This mini-project showcases a clean and modern job tracking app built with React, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS. It emphasizes functional state management, responsive UI design, and efficient sorting with dark mode support.
## Technologies Used

- React (with functional components and hooks)
- TypeScript (type-safe logic and reusable components)
- Tailwind CSS (utility-first styling and dark mode)
- Vite (modern project scaffolding and fast dev environment)

## Features

- Add and track job applications
- Mark jobs as applied or not applied
- Toggle between light and dark mode
- Sort jobs alphabetically for quick access
- Responsive layout with utility-based design

## Purpose
This project helped me:
- Strengthen my React + TypeScript integration
- Apply Tailwind utility classes for fast and adaptive styling
- Manage component state and DOM interaction in a clean way
- Reinforce dark mode toggling logic using Tailwindâ€™s class strategy

## Status
Completed as a self-built showcase of UI logic, component reusability, and TypeScript confidence. Kept intentionally lightweight and focused to highlight core technologies and modern design patterns.
